# idlecontainer
A program that limit a container to use IDLE cpu resources

This project started around the idea to be able to run project like BOINC on IDLE resources via container technology. IDLE container is a program that will throttle a container CPU quota in regards of the CPU usage of the hosts.

It means to have a very low CPU and RAM footprint in order to limits impact on the system.

The use of container technology allow to use unused server CPU resources for non critical applications.
